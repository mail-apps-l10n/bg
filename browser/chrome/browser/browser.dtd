<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE This file contains the browser main menu items -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE Do not translate commandkeys --> 
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.title): DONT_TRANSLATE -->


<!ENTITY mainWindow.title "&brandFullName;">
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlemodifier) : DONT_TRANSLATE -->
<!ENTITY mainWindow.titlemodifier "&brandFullName;">
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlemodifiermenuseparator): DONT_TRANSLATE -->
<!ENTITY mainWindow.titlemodifiermenuseparator " - ">
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlePrivateBrowsingSuffix): This will be appended to the window's title
                                                                inside the private browsing mode -->


<!-- Tab context menu -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (closeTabsToTheEnd.label): This should indicate the
direction in which tabs are closed, i.e. locales that use RTL mode should say
left instead of right. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pinTab.label, unpinTab.label): "Pin" is being
used as a metaphor for expressing the fact that these tabs are "pinned" to the
left edge of the tabstrip. Really we just want the string to express the idea
that this is a lightweight and reversible action that keeps your tab where you
can reach it easily. -->


















<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (openLocationCmd.label): "Open Location" is only
displayed on OS X, and only on windows that aren't main browser windows, or
when there are no windows but Firefox is still running. -->






























<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (enterFullScreenCmd.label, exitFullScreenCmd.label):
These should match what Safari and other Apple applications use on OS X Lion. -->






































































<!-- Toolbar items -->







<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (bookmarksSidebarGtkCmd.commandkey): This command
  -  key should not contain the letters A-F, since these are reserved
  -  shortcut keys on Linux. -->

































<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (scratchpad.label): This menu item label appears
  -  in the Tools menu. See bug 653093.
  -  The Scratchpad is intended to provide a simple text editor for creating
  -  and evaluating bits of JavaScript code for the purposes of function
  -  prototyping, experimentation and convenient scripting.
  -
  -  It's quite possible that you won't have a good analogue for the word
  -  "Scratchpad" in your locale. You should feel free to find a close
  -  approximation to it or choose a word (or words) that means
  -  "simple discardable text editor". -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (browserToolboxMenu.label): This is the label for the
  -  application menu item that opens the browser toolbox UI in the Tools menu. -->


































































<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (historyUndoWindowMenu): see bug 394759 -->



















<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.moveToPanel.accesskey) can appear on the
     same context menu as menubarCmd and personalbarCmd, so they should have
     different access keys. customizeMenu.moveToToolbar and 
     customizeMenu.moveToPanel are mutually exclusive, so can share access
     keys.  -->











<!-- 
  Comment duplicated from browser-sets.inc:

  Search Command Key Logic works like this:

  Unix: Ctrl+J (0.8, 0.9 support)
        Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
  Mac:  Cmd+K (cross platform binding)
        Cmd+Opt+F (platform convention)
  Win:  Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
        Ctrl+E (IE compat)

  We support Ctrl+K on all platforms now and advertise it in the menu since it is
  our standard - it is a "safe" choice since it is near no harmful keys like "W" as
  "E" is. People mourning the loss of Ctrl+K for emacs compat can switch their GTK
  system setting to use emacs emulation, and we should respect it. Focus-Search-Box
  is a fundamental keybinding and we are maintaining a XP binding so that it is easy
  for people to switch to Linux.

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (viewPartialSourceCmd.accesskey): This accesskey is used for both 
         viewPartialSourceForSelectionCmd.label and viewPartialSourceForMathMLCmd.label -->































<!-- alternate for content area context menu -->





































<!-- Media (video/audio) controls -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Play" and
"Pause" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Mute" and
"Unmute" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->











<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: "Ludicrous Speed" is a reference to the
movie "Space Balls" and is meant to say that this speed is very
fast. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Show Controls" and
"Hide Controls" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->







<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Show Statistics" and
"Hide Statistics" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE :
fullZoomEnlargeCmd.commandkey3, fullZoomReduceCmd.commandkey2 and
fullZoomResetCmd.commandkey2 are alternative acceleration keys for zoom.
If shift key is needed with your locale popular keyboard for them,
you can use these alternative items. Otherwise, their values should be empty.  -->


<!-- + is above this key on many keyboards -->
<!ENTITY fullZoomEnlargeCmd.commandkey3 "">



<!ENTITY fullZoomReduceCmd.commandkey2  "">



<!ENTITY fullZoomResetCmd.commandkey2   "">













<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE(quitApplicationCmdUnix.key): This keyboard shortcut is used by both Linux and OSX builds. -->











<!-- On Windows we use the term "Options" to describe settings, but
     on Linux and Mac OS X we use "Preferences" - carry that distinction
     over into this string, which is used in the "popup blocked" info bar . -->























<!-- Localization note (identity.runBy) : This string appears between a
domain name (above) and an organization name (below). E.g.

example.com
which is run by
Example Enterprises, Inc.

The layout of the identity dialog prevents combining this into a single string with
substitution variables.  If it is difficult to translate the sense of the string
with that structure, consider a translation which ignores the preceding domain and
just addresses the organization to follow, e.g. "This site is run by " -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (identity.help.tooltip) : This string should be the
     localized title of this SUMO article
     https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure -->
<!-- Name for the tabs toolbar as spoken by screen readers.
     The word "toolbar" is appended automatically and should not be contained below! -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (syncTabsMenu2.label): This appears in the history menu -->


















































<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pluginActivateNow.label, pluginActivateAlways.label, pluginBlockNow.label): These should be the same as the matching strings in browser.properties -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (pluginNotification.width): This is used to determine the
     width of the plugin popup notification that can appear if a plugin has been
     blocked on a page. Should be wide enough to fit the pluginActivateNow.label
     and pluginActivateAlways.label strings above on a single line. This must be
     a CSS length value. -->
